1. Difference Between fp32 and fp64 Data Types
In Rust, floating-point numbers can be represented by two types

f32: 32-bit floating-point number 
f64: 64-bit floating-point number
            Key Differences
Bit Size:
f32 uses 32 bits to represent a number.
f64 uses 64 bits, which allows for more precision and a larger range.

Precision:
f32 gives you approximately 7 decimal digits of precision.
f64 gives you approximately 15-16 decimal digits of precision

f32 = 1.1234567; // 7 decimal places, limited precision
f64 = 1.1234567891234567; // 15-16 decimal places, high precision


Range:
f32 can represent numbers between 1.4 x 10^-45 to 3.4 x 10^38.
f64 can represent numbers between 5.0 x 10^-324 to 1.8 x 10^308

Memory Usage:
f32 uses less memory (4 bytes).
f64 uses double the memory (8 bytes).

When to Use:
we can use f32 when performance and memory efficiency are important and precision isn’t critical (e.g., graphics, gaming, some ML models).
we can use  f64 when higher precision or a larger range is needed (e.g., scientific computations, financial calculations).


2. Role of Pointers in Memory Management in Rust
In Rust, pointers are crucial for memory management, but unlike languages like C or C++, Rust provides safe memory management through its ownership model, ensuring that most pointer issues (like dangling pointers, null pointers, etc.) are handled at compile-time.

                        Key Points About Pointers in Rust


Memory Address:
In Rust, pointers store the memory address of a variable. These are like references to variables stored elsewhere in memory, allowing you to directly manipulate the data.

let x = 10;
let y = &x; // `y` is a pointer to `x`
println!("The value of x is: {}", x); // Accessing value of `x` directly

Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Rust automatically manages dynamic memory through its ownership model, but  can be  manually allocate  using Box<T>, Rc<T> (reference-counted), and Arc<T> (atomic reference-counted) for heap-allocated data.

Efficient Data Access:
By using references (essentially pointers) in Rust, data can be passed around efficiently without being copied.
let s = String::from("Hello");
let t = &s; // Borrowing a reference to `s`
println!("{}", t); // Access data without copying

Pass-by-Reference:
Rust uses references (&T) and mutable references (&mut T) to allow functions to modify variables without making copies.

Pointer Arithmetic:
Rust does not allow pointer arithmetic in safe code. This prevents mistakes like buffer overflows and out-of-bounds access. 


Memory Management:
Rust uses a borrow checker and ownership system to prevent memory leaks. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates memory (destruction) without needing explicit free() or delete() commands.


in summary Pointers in Rust are used to reference data in memory efficiently without copying.
Rust’s ownership and borrowing system ensures memory safety, and dynamic memory allocation is done using Box, Rc, Arc, and other structures.
Rust doesn’t allow pointer arithmetic in safe code to prevent common errors (e.g., buffer overflows), but you can use unsafe blocks if necessary, although they should be used with caution.



difference between &str and string 

&str: This is a string slice, which is an immutable reference to a portion of a string. It does not own the data it references; instead, it borrows the data from another source, such as a String or a string literal. &str is lightweight and useful when you only need to view a part of a string without owning it. It is commonly used for function parameters when you do not need to modify the string.

String: This is a growable, heap-allocated, UTF-8 encoded string. It owns its data and can be modified and resized at runtime. You can create a new String by calling String::new() or by converting from a string slice using to_string(). String is mutable and can be used in scenarios where you need to build or modify strings dyn
