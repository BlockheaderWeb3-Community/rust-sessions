Difference between f32 and f64

1. Size and Memory Usage

f32 takes 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory, whereas f64 takes 8 bytes (64 bits).
Because of the smaller size, f32 uses less memory, which can be useful in memory-constrained environments (e.g., embedded systems, GPUs).

2. Precision

f32 has 6–9 decimal digits of precision.
This means that the smallest difference between two numbers that f32 can distinguish is on the order of 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁹, depending on the number's size.

f64 has 15–17 decimal digits of precision.
This provides more accurate representation of floating-point numbers with less rounding errors compared to f32. f64 is more suitable for scientific, financial, and high-precision calculations.

3. Range

f32 has a range of approximately ±3.4 × 10⁻³⁸ to ±3.4 × 10³⁸.
f64 has a range of approximately ±1.7 × 10⁻³⁰ to ±1.7 × 10³⁰.

The f64 type can represent much larger and much smaller numbers than f32, which is important in fields like astronomy, physics simulations, or high-precision calculations.
